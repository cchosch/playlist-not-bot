This is a discord bot that uses a slave discord account to queue songs up

# configuration

Make a `config.json` file in the root folder and put your bot's token, your slave account's (real discord account) token and your desired bot prefix like this:

```json
{
  "master_auth": "BOT TOKEN HERE",
  "slave_auth": "SLAVE ACCOUNT TOKEN HERE",
  "prefix": ";"
}
```

DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS FILE OR USE THESE TOKENS IN PLAIN TEXT ANYWHERE IN YOUR PROJECT IF YOU PLAN ON COMMITING TO GITHUB AT ANY TIME, THIS WILL GIVE HACKERS THE ABILITY TO HACK THE DISCORD ACCOUNTS WITH THESE TOKENS
